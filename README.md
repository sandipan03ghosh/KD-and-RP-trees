# KD-and-RP-trees
->Implemented highly efficient space search algorithms were implemented using KD-Trees and Random Projection (RP) Trees, resulting in a reduction of k-nearest neighbors search time by over 100 times compared to the naive approach. This significant improvement in performance was essential for applications requiring rapid and accurate nearest neighbor searches in high-dimensional spaces.
->The solution was designed with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, ensuring modularity by creating separate classes for vectors, databases, RP Trees, and KD Trees. Proper parts were organized with distinct header files, promoting code readability and maintenance. This modular approach facilitated the scalability and extension of the code, allowing for future enhancements or adaptations to different use cases.
->Significant speed improvements were achieved, and a thorough analysis of the impact of vector dimensionality on search performance was conducted. The robust capabilities of the KD-Tree and RP Tree algorithms in handling high-dimensional data were demonstrated, providing valuable insights into their performance characteristics under various conditions.
->Overall, the implementation of KD-Trees and RP Trees not only optimized search efficiency but also provided a well-structured and extensible framework for future developments in space search algorithms.
